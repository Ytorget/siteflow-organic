# InfoGenius Vision

**A Siteflow Innovation Project**

InfoGenius Vision is a next-generation visual research engine, **concepted and built by the team at Siteflow** during our spare time. We created this project to explore the intersection of structured data, real-time research, and generative art.

## 🚀 About Siteflow's Experiment

At **Siteflow**, we believe in learning by doing. This application represents our exploration into the capabilities of Google's Gemini 3 models. It is not just a demo, but a testament to our team's commitment to mastering emerging technologies outside of our daily operations.

## ✨ What It Does

InfoGenius Vision allows users to input any topic and instantly generate high-fidelity infographics. Unlike standard image generators, our engine acts as a researcher first:

1.  **Researches**: Uses Google Search Grounding to find verified facts.
2.  **Analyzes**: Adapts content complexity for audiences ranging from Elementary School to Experts.
3.  **Designs**: Generates tailored prompts for the `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` model.
4.  **Visualizes**: Renders stunning diagrams in styles like Minimalist, Cyberpunk, or Vintage Scientific.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
