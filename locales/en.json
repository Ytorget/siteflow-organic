        "answer": "Initially, the investment may be slightly higher than a standard WordPress template, yes. But over time? No. Our customers often reduce their operating costs by 50-80% because our systems require significantly less server power and less manual maintenance. It's cheaper to build it right once than to fix it every month."
      },
      {
        "question": "What technology do you build with?",
        "answer": "We are technology agnostic but prefer BEAM (Erlang/Elixir) for systems that require extreme reliability and scalability. It's the same technology that powers WhatsApp and parts of 5G networks. For frontend, we use modern frameworks like React or Phoenix LiveView depending on needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do we have to replace everything we have?",
        "answer": "Rarely. We believe in evolution, not revolution. Often we can build a 'streaming layer' that handles the heavy lifting, while your old systems can live on in the background until they are phased out naturally. We integrate seamlessly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does a project take?",
        "answer": "A feasibility study often takes 1-2 weeks. A first MVP system (Minimum Viable Product) can often be ready in 4-8 weeks. Since we build modularly, we can deliver value quickly instead of waiting a year for a 'big bang' launch."
